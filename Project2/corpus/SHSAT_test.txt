No one knows when or where the first banjo was created.
Q. Once on our continent, it has undergone many changes and appeared in various forms.
R. For example, the number of banjo strings has varied between two and five, with five strings being standard today.
S. However, similar stringed instruments have been played in Indian and Arab countries for thousands of years.
T. Arab traders may have brought the instrument from Asia to the west coast of Africa.
U. At any rate, in the eighteenth century, the banjo arrived in North America, along with enslaved Africans.

Chinese sailors used magnetic compasses long before Europeans did.  
Q. Then, hanging in a windless place, the magnetized end of the needle would always point to the south.
R. The magician would magnetize a needle and balance it on the rim of a cup to act as a compass.
S. This balancing act was hard to maintain, and the needle often fell off.
T. In fact, some of the earliest compasses in recorded history were made by "magicians" in ancient China.
U. A more effective way to keep the needle free to move in response to its magnetic pull was to attach a strand of silk to the center of the needle with a tiny piece of wax.

In the west, we are most familiar with world explorers who were of European origin.
Q. Marco Polo, a European who traveled to China in the thirteenth century, serves as a classic example.
R. Perhaps the most far-flung of these lesser known travelers was Ibn Batuta, a North African who left his birthplace of Tangier in the year 1325.
S. Ibn Batuta traveled all over Africa and Asia, including China, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands, and the coast of East Africa.
T. Some lesser known explorers, however, logged enough miles and adventures to make Marco Polo's journey look like an evening stroll.
U. Batuta's journeying lasted 24 years and covered at least 75,000 miles, most of it by land, a record that would not be surpassed for another 500 years.

The processionary caterpillar illustrates how an insect species relies on instinct in its daily routines.
Q. Dozens of caterpillars nest in a tree during the day, then leave together at night in search of food.
R. After feeding, the caterpillars also use the silken "road" to help them return to their nest.
S. As they leave the nest, one caterpillar becomes the leader who spins and lays out a silk line as it moves along.
T. The processionary's instinct is so strong that, if a person were to pick up one end of the silk line and bring it around to join the other end, creating a closed circle, the caterpillars might travel around the loop for days without changing course.
U. The other caterpillars line up end to end and walk on the leader's silk line, each one reinforcing the rope by laying down its own silk as it passes over.

Helen Suzman was a member of the South African Parliament from 1953 to 1993.
Q. Despite this international recognition of her work, Suzman was largely unsuccessful during most of her career in her efforts to defeat apartheid.
R. She has, however, been given numerous other human-rights awards and honorary degrees from several universities, including Oxford, Harvard, and Brandeis.
S. At last, Suzman saw her dream fulfilled with the decision of the South African Parliament to dismantle the apartheid system, and she has retired from public life.
T. In recognition of her personal efforts, Suzman was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three different times, but she has never won.
U. An outspoken critic of apartheid during those forty years, she was often the only one to voice her protest against the policies of the South African government.

Jules Verne wrote about travel to the moon more than 100 years ago, but he was not the first writer to do so.
Q. Three hundred years before Verne, Johannes Kepler, probably the first scientist to recognize that the atmosphere of the Earth gave out before reaching the moon, wrote about an imaginary trip there.
R. Thus, while Jules Verne is credited with writing the first "realistic" science fiction, it is clear that space travel has haunted people's imaginations for centuries.
S. Even earlier, in a.d. 1010, a Persian poet described a trip to the moon on a throne pulled by eagles.
T. Perhaps credit for the first space flight description, however, should go to a secondcentury Greek whose fictional sailing ship was caught up in a whirlwind that blew it to the moon.
U. A contemporary of Kepler's, Francis Godwin, wrote of men carried to the moon by geese.

In many cultures, a baby's first steps are an occasion to be remembered.
Q. In traditional Indian families, however, those first steps are celebrated as a ceremonial event.
R. When a child is ready to begin walking, the parents fit it with specially designed ankle bracelets, adorned with gently ringing bells.
S. Some of these carts are intricately decorated to resemble the chariot of Krishna, another important Hindu deity.
T. The sound of these bells mimics the footsteps of the legendary child Rama, a major Hindu deity.
U. In addition, the child may be given a handcrafted walker or pushcart to provide support for its first steps.

The Midwestern plains of the United States experience more tornadoes than any other part of the country.
Q. This funnel is a rotating column of air, with a speed approaching 300 miles an hour.
R. Still, though tornadoes can be powerful and destructive, each one lasts only a few minutes and then disappears.
S. The fastest tornado wind speed ever recorded was 318 miles per hour, measured by a Doppler on Wheels radar in Oklahoma City in 1999.
T. It is here, meteorologists have observed, that the unsettled weather conditions during the spring months are nearly perfect for tornado formation.
U. When cold dry air from Canada passes over the Rocky Mountains and collides with warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, the resulting disturbance may form a violent funnel cloud.

The giant panda, a native of the remote mountainous regions of China, is a most unusual bear species.
Q. The panda, on the other hand, subsists almost entirely on tender bamboo shoots.
R. The panda's paw is quite different; it has an overdeveloped bone jutting out like a thumb below its five other claws.
S. Most other bear species also have paws that are designed for running, stabbing, and scratching.
T. For example, most other bears are hunters and gatherers that prey on smaller animals and forage for roots and berries.
U. It is this thumb-like structure that permits the panda to grip bamboo shoots and strip them of their leaves.

Most people would argue that it is impossible to tie a knot in the middle of a rope while holding both ends.
Q. If you do this without letting go of the rope, it will automatically tie itself into a simple knot as your arms unfold.
R. With your arms folded, bend down and grip one end of the rope in your right hand, the other in your left, and simply unfold your arms and draw the ends of the rope in opposite directions.
S. Begin by laying a short piece of rope or cord straight out on a table.
T. However, you can easily prove them wrong by using a simple trick.
U. Then, fold your arms completely, making sure that one hand is below its opposite elbow and the other hand above.

The spirit of the American Revolutionary War is apparent in the songs that were sung during that war.
Q. Tradition has it that the American army band even played "Yankee Doodle" to the surrendering British at Yorktown in 1781.
R. Another American original, "Chester," written by William Billings during the Revolution, was sung around many campfires by American troops.
S. The first American patriotic ballad, "The Liberty Song," was published in 1768, well before the Revolution began.
T. The Americans liked the song, however, and later in the Revolutionary War, took it for their own.
U. Unlike those two, the song "Yankee Doodle," also popular during the Revolution, had first been sung by the British in mockery of the colonial troops during the French and Indian War.

Scientists have long known that chimpanzees have the ability to invent and use tools for the purpose of gathering and preparing food.
Q. However, more recently, researchers have observed a Tanzanian mountain chimpanzee demonstrate that chimps are also capable of inventing tools for other purposes.
R. The afflicted Kalunde suffered from a hacking cough and severely congested nasal passages.
S. This congestion forced Kalunde to breathe through his mouth, so he needed to clear his nasal passages in order to eat.
T. On four separate occasions, researchers observed Kalunde accomplish this goal by inserting a twig or plant stem into his nose, thus stimulating his reflex to sneeze.
U. These researchers were studying Kalunde, who, like many other chimps in his group, had a case of the dry-season flu.

What song is sung more often than any other song in the United States, with the exception of the national anthem?
Q. Surprisingly, neither the composer nor the lyricist had ever even been to a baseball park at the time the song was written in 1910.
R. The answer is "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," probably the best-known song ever written about the sport traditionally called "America's national pastime."
S. Albert von Tilzer, the lyricist, eventually went to a ballgame in the 1920s.
T. Twenty years after Tilzer went, composer Jack Norworth saw the Brooklyn Dodgers defeat the Chicago Cubs in his first Major League game.
U. It is usually sung during the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game.

For centuries, the Indigenous people of Australia have used musical rituals to map out a network of invisible pathways covering much of Australia.
Q. Researchers believe that the singers communicate these features to their listeners through the use of commonly understood patterns of notes and rhythms.
R. Songlines are so detailed and specific that a listener can identify geographic features: rivers, mountains, deserts, and sand dunes.
S. It is thought that such patterns enable members of different clans, who speak different languages, to decode each other's songlines.
T. These rituals, called "songlines," describe the terrain and landmarks along a traveler's route.
U. However, the opportunities to study songlines are disappearing rapidly, as the Indigenous way of life is changed by Western civilization.

The now-abandoned settlement of Nan Madol, located on a coral reef off the shore of the Micronesian island of Pohnpei, was built over a thousand years, beginning around a.d. 500.
Q. The new building materials—some pieces were twenty feet long and weighed nearly six tons—were transported to Pohnpei on rafts.
R. The ancestors would build a great fire around a column, then pour cool seawater on it, causing it to split along natural fracture lines.
S. Then they were placed in their present positions by means of hibiscus fiber ropes and the inclined trunks of coconut palm trees.
T. The islanders say that their ancestors obtained the stone from quarries on a nearby island, where large basalt columns were formed naturally by the cooling of molten lava.
U. The structures of Nan Madol are remarkable for the sheer size of the stone "logs" or columns used to create the retaining walls of the offshore community, and anthropologists must rely on information provided by local people to learn how Nan Madol was built.

Macaws, a type of parrot found in South America, are among the largest and most beautiful birds in the world.
Q. Scientists believe that the birds may eat the clay in order to counteract poisons contained in some of these fruit seeds.
R. The birds do not appear to eat clay to satisfy hunger; they ingest it even when fruit seeds, their favorite foods, are available.
S. Like many other parrot species, they are very intelligent as well, yet some of their behaviors have baffled scientists.
T. This theory is supported by the fact that the birds eat more clay in the dry season, when less-poisonous food is scarce.
U. For example, macaws regularly flock to riverbanks to eat the clay found in river mud.
SURQT

To the earliest European traders, Africa seemed to be loosely organized into tribal societies, without any great centers of wealth or learning.
Q. He described a thriving metropolis with great universities and dozens of private libraries.
R. Unfortunately, by the nineteenth century raids by neighboring tribes had made Timbuktu a shadow of its former self.
S. This impression began to change in the fifteenth century, as Europeans traveled inland into western Africa.
T. In 1470, an Italian merchant named Benedetto Dei traveled to Timbuktu and confirmed these stories.
U. The travelers told tales of an enormous city, known as Timbuktu, on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, where the markets were crowded with goods and gold was bought and sold.

The Codex Mendoza is a fascinating document describing the culture and traditions of the Aztec Indians before the Spanish conquest.
Q. A boy was often named for the date of his birth or for an animal or ancestor, or even for some event at the time of his birth.
R. The parents would also place in the child's hands the implements that he or she would use in adult life, gently guiding them in the motions of use.
S. Instruments used to weave and spin were given to the girls, while tools and weapons were given to the boys.
T. One tradition it describes is the feast hosted by the parents of a newborn child to give that child a name.
U. Girls' names, on the other hand, were frequently created to include the Aztec word for flower, xóchitl.

Stephen Crane was 24 years old when his classic Civil War novel The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895.
Q. Unfortunately, his first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, which chronicled life among the poor in New York City's Bowery slums, was not as successful.
R. That novel, his second, brought him almost overnight international celebrity status.
S. One story says that, in an attempt to recoup his losses, Crane paid people to ride the Manhattan El train carrying copies of the book.
T. Maggie was self-published by Crane when he was only 21, using money borrowed from his brother.
U. The loan became a loss—the gritty social realism of Maggie earned Crane praise from critics, but he probably gave away more copies than he sold.

It might be assumed that a nature preserve would be located in a pristine wilderness, far from the noise and pollution of the city.
Q. A pair of bird watchers had followed one of them heading toward the island and found a thriving colony with nearly 100 nests.
R. During World War I, the 45-acre island was home to a petroleum refinery and two shipbuilding companies, but later Shooter's Island became a dumping ground.
S. But Shooter's Island, a nature preserve just north of Staten Island, is an exception to the rule.
T. Nowadays, although there is no public access to the bird colonies on Shooter's Island, its winged inhabitants daily bring enjoyment to city dwellers who see them "commuting" into city parks.
U. In 1974, however, it was discovered that the abandoned dry docks there had become home to many water birds.

Ancient people of the Mediterranean thought that volcanoes were caused by Vulcan, the Roman blacksmith god.
Q. In the same park, Mauna Loa, at 28,000 feet above the ocean's floor, is the largest active volcano in the world.
R. There are dozens of active and potentially active volcanoes within the United States, including Kilauea, the most active volcano in the world.
S. Both of these are shield volcanoes, which means that they were formed as lava flowed in all directions from a central vent to form low, gently sloping mountains.
T. Volcanoes, which were named for Vulcan, are vents in the crust of the earth from which molten lava and ash erupt.
U. That volcano, located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, has been spewing lava since 1983.

A Canadian astronomer, Dr. Philip Stooke, is known for his detailed maps of the earth's moon.
Q. Certain that people must have observed and drawn images of the moon before that date, Stooke examined old manuscripts, history books, and records of archaeological excavations.
R. When a drawing of the tomb carving was placed over a picture of the full moon, the markings lined up.
S. He found a photograph of a carving of dots and lines from a prehistoric tomb in County Meath, Ireland, estimated to be 5,000 years old.
T. "It is without doubt a map of the moon, the most ancient one ever found," Stooke concluded.
U. He had long been puzzled by the lack of moon maps older than the one created in 1505 by Leonardo da Vinci.

The secret to teaching a parakeet to talk is the realization that a "talking" bird is simply imitating what it hears, not putting its own ideas into words.
Q. As you leave, don't give a word of farewell.
R. Stay just out of sight of the bird and repeat the phrase you want it to learn for at least 15 minutes every morning and evening.
S. After your repetitions, leave the bird alone for a while.
T. Otherwise the bird might combine that word, such as "Goodbye," with the phrase you are trying to teach it.
U. For this reason, when you train your bird to repeat your words, eliminate any distractions, especially other noises, during its "lessons."

Some traditional households in sub-Saharan Africa serve two meals a day, one at noon and the other in the evening.
Q. African food can be very spicy, and the starch cools the burning effect of the main dish.
R. The starch serves another purpose as well.
S. Diners then use the starch to scoop up a portion of the main dish.
T. A typical meal consists of a thick stew or soup as the main course, along with some sort of starch—bread, rice, or fufu, a starchy grain paste similar in consistency to mashed potatoes.
U. The main dish is usually served on individual plates, and the starch is served on a communal plate, from which diners break off a piece of bread or scoop rice or fufu in their fingers.

In the remote mountain country of Nepal, a small band of "honey hunters" carry out a tradition so ancient that it is depicted in drawings dating back 10,000 years.
Q. Throughout this entire dangerous practice, the hunter is stung repeatedly.
R. To harvest the honey from these combs, a honey hunter climbs above the nest, lowers a bamboo-fiber ladder over the cliff, and climbs down.
S. The honeybees that colonize the Nepalese mountainsides are among the largest in the world, building huge honeycombs on sheer rock faces that may be hundreds of feet high.
T. Only veteran honey hunters, with skin that has been toughened over the years, can return from a hunt without the painful swelling caused by these stings.
U. Once he has reached the level of the nest, the hunter uses two sturdy bamboo poles like huge chopsticks to pull it away from the mountainside and into a large basket, which is then lowered to people waiting below.

In most dictionaries, the first meaning listed for "bluegrass" refers to a bluish-green grass frequently grown in Kentucky; the second meaning usually refers to a type of country music.
Q. You won't hear that style at any of the dozens of traditional bluegrass festivals held each year across the United States.
R. Included among the non-amplified strings will be guitars, banjos, mandolins, and fiddles, but never drums or accordions.
S. If, on the other hand, either the instruments or the music is non-traditional, the music may be called "newgrass."
T. The traditional rapid-fire bluegrass sound that was Monroe's trademark is played on non-amplified stringed instruments and features free improvisation.
U. The connection between those two meanings is a band called the Blue Grass Boys— named in honor of the state of Kentucky—whose leader, Bill Monroe, effectively created this style of music.

In the 1880s, John Wesley Powell, an explorer of the Grand Canyon and director of the United States Geological Survey, led the development of the first topographical maps of the entire United States.
Q. This is because streams cut into the land, so contour lines will turn upstream, cross the waterway, and return downstream, creating a V shape, with the "V" pointing upstream.
R. Waterways, such as streams, are usually marked in blue on topo maps, but even if they were not, the presence of one could still be identified using contour lines.
S. Contour lines indicate the slope of the land as well.
T. If the lines are close together, the elevation is changing rapidly and the slope is steep, whereas widely spaced lines depict a gently sloping terrain.
U. Also called "topo maps," these maps differ from others in using thin brown lines, called contour lines, to connect points of equal elevation.

In the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere, an energy-efficient house should have most of its windows facing south.
Q. The reason that architects and builders want this "southern exposure" is related to the position of the sun in the sky.
R. To take advantage of this, during the winter the south-facing windows should be uncovered during the day, allowing sunlight—and heat—to penetrate directly into the living space.
S. Though the sun always rises in the east and sets in the west, in the Northern Hemisphere the sun is permanently situated in the southern portion of the sky.
T. In these ways, the sun's warmth is retained in the house, a form of passive solar heating.
U. At night, when temperatures go down, the windows should be covered by curtains or other insulating materials to prevent the heat from escaping.

Tycho Brahe, a seventeenth-century Danish astronomer, is more famous for his odd and arrogant personality than for any contribution he made to our knowledge of the stars and planets.
Q. That discovery was made by his assistant, Johannes Kepler, who had been denied full access to Brahe's data until after Brahe's death.
R. The disagreement turned into a sword fight, and part of Brahe's nose was sliced off.
S. As a student, he got into an argument with another student about who was the better mathematician.
T. He made a replacement nose for himself out of an alloy of gold and silver, which he reportedly glued to his face.
U. Later in his life, his arrogance may have kept him from playing a part in one of the greatest astronomical discoveries in history—the elliptical orbits of the planets around the sun.

Most cowboys of North and South America lacked the necessary chemicals to soften animal hides into leather, so they often used rough, untreated hides, or rawhide, for their gear.
Q. The result was a soft, supple piece of leather for making reins, halters, straps, and other cowboy gear.
R. The strip was pulled through the slot repeatedly, with the stick held at a slight angle so that it took effort to draw the strip through.
S. They took a round piece of wood, such as a broom handle, cut a lengthwise slot through the middle of it, and filed the edges of the slot until they were smooth.
T. However, the gauchos, the cowboys of South America, created an effective method for softening strips of rawhide without the need for chemicals.
U. The gauchos then rubbed a rawhide strip with saddle soap and inserted one end into the slot.

Caving, the recreational pastime of exploring caves, is an obsession for people called cavers or spelunkers, who dream of finding caves never explored before.
Q. Preserving caves from damage is important because they are part of the system of aquifers that store ground water.
R. Occasionally a new series of caves is discovered by some of these devoted and lucky spelunkers.
S. For example, the cave-dwelling bacteria Actinomyctes possesses antibiotic properties— according to some cavers with colds, it has eliminated their cold symptoms while underground.
T. Equally as important, scientists believe that newly-discovered caves may contain disease-fighting microorganisms not found in any other environment.
U. After such a discovery, the role of the caver shifts from explorer to protector because the cave environment is so easily damaged.

When contemporary Native American tribes meet for a powwow, one of the most popular ceremonies is the women's jingle dress dance.
Q. During this type of dance, the dancers blend complicated footwork with a series of gentle hops, done in rhythm to a drumbeat.
R. In the past, it is believed, the dress worn by the jingle-dress dancer was adorned by shells.
S. These actions cause decorations sewn on the dancer's dress to strike each other as she performs, creating a lovely jingling sound.
T. Besides being more readily available than shells, the lids are thought to create a softer, more subtle sound.
U. The modern jingle dress no longer has shells, but is decorated with rows of tin cones, made from the lids of snuff cans, rolled up and sewn onto the dress.

The Tsachin are a nomadic group of about 300 people who live in the mountains and forests of northern Mongolia, near the Russian border.
Q. They are completely dependent on their reindeer herds for food, clothing, and transportation.
R. After the reindeer cows have their calves, the Tsachin immediately begin to gather the milk, from which they make cheese, yogurt, and other dairy-based foods.
S. The most difficult part of the migration for the Tsachin is the spring, when the reindeer leave their wintering grounds and travel to the places where they give birth.
T. The Tsachin people follow them on these migrations, moving six to eight times a year and living in portable shelters that resemble Native American tepees.
U. Some of these animals are tamed for riding or milking, but the herds are allowed to roam freely as they migrate.
