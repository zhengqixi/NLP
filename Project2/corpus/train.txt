Some studies suggest that at least some bird species have evolved
mental skills similar to those found in humans and apes. 


______ (Q) When such mirror-induced behavior in the magpie, a
songbird species from the crow family, was examined some individuals behaved in
front of the mirror similarly to apes. 


______ (R) It is, however, not yet clear whether these skills are
accompanied by an understanding of the self. 


______ (S) This is indicated by feats such as tool use,
episodic-like memory, and the ability to use one's own experience in predicting
the behavior of members of one’s own species. 


______ (T) For example, when they noticed a color mark on their
bodies, magpies tried to remove the mark.



______ (U) In apes, behavior in response to a mirror, in which the
ape clearly recognizes himself, has been taken as evidence of self-recognition.

The lotus (Sanskrit and Tibetan padma), because of it’s conditions
and growth, is one of the most poignant representations of Buddhist teaching.


______ (Q) This pattern of growth symbolizes the progress of the
soul from the primeval mud of materialism, through the waters of experience,
and into the bright sunshine of enlightenment.


______ (R) According to another scholar, "In esoteric
Buddhism the heart of a being is like an unopened lotus: when the virtues of
the Buddha develop therein, the lotus blossoms; that is why the Buddha sits on
a lotus bloom."



______ (S) Though there are other water plants that also bloom
above the water, it is only the lotus which, owing to the strength of its stem,
regularly rises eight to twelve inches above the surface. 


______ (T) Realizing the unique circumstances of the flower and
its differences from others, 
Lalitavistara states, "The spirit of the best of people is
spotless, like the lotus in the muddy water which has not become muddy." 


______ (U) The roots of a lotus are, after all, in the mud, the
stem growing through the water, the heavily scented flower lying pristinely
above the water, basking in the sunlight.

On April 21, 1918 Baron von Richthofen followed the Sopwith Camel
of Wilfred May far into British territory. 


______ (Q) Manfred von Richthofen crashed into a field alongside
the road from Corbie to Bray, his body was recovered by British forces, and he
was buried with full military honors.


______ (R) He did this even though the thrill of the hunt was all
but gone for Richthofen, as most of his peers had already been killed and his
own wounds agonized him. 


______ (S) The shot is commonly believed to have come from
Australian gunners on the ground, but might have also come from the guns of
Canadian flier Arthur "Roy" Brown who was coming to May's aid.


______ (T) Though he had written that it was undignified to chase
an enemy who had fled, he chased his British quarry far deep into enemy
territory and far lower to the ground than was prudent. 


______ (U) May later said that it was only his erratic, untrained
piloting which saved him and as Richthofen followed the erratic path of the novice
pilot, a single bullet, shot from behind him, passed diagonally through his
chest.

In an analysis almost 147 years after his death, doctors believe
that writer Edgar Allan Poe died as a result of rabies, not from complications
of alcoholism. 


______ (Q) Poe's medical case was reviewed by R. Michael
Benitez, M.D., a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center.


______(R) At first he had tremors and hallucinations, then slipped into a coma, emerged
from the coma, was calm and lucid, but then lapsed again into a delirious
state, became combative, and required restraint, finally dying on his fourth
day in the hospital.


______ (S) "No one can say conclusively that Poe died of
rabies, since there was no autopsy after his death," says Dr. Benitez, who
is also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School
of Medicine. 


______ (T) "But the historical accounts of Poe's condition in
the hospital a few days before his death point to a strong possibility that he
had rabies.”


______ (U) Poe was discovered lying unconscious on September
28  outside a saloon on Lombard St. in
Baltimore, before being taken to Washington College Hospital.

Elephants are profoundly social creatures. 


______ (Q) This sense of cohesion is further enforced by the
elaborate communication system that elephants use.


______ (R) Afterwards young females are socialized into the
matriarchal network while young males go off for a time into an all-male social
group before coming back into the fold as mature adults.


______ (S) When communicating over long distances — in
order to pass along news about threats, a change of plans or, of the utmost
importance to elephants, the death of a community member — they use patterns of
subsonic vibrations that are felt as far as several miles away by sensors in
the padding of their feet.


______ (T) For example, young elephants stay within 15 feet of
their mothers for nearly all of their first eight years of life.  


______ (U) They employ a range of vocalizations, from
low-frequency rumbles to higher-pitched screams and trumpets, along with a
variety of visual signals, from the waving of their trunks to subtle anglings of
the head, body, feet and tail.

Michael Peter Fay, an American teenager visiting Singapore in
1991, plead guilty to vandalism charges, and was sentenced to four months in
jail, a $2,200 fine - and four strokes of the cane. 


______ (Q) A prison official, a medical officer and the caner were
the only ones present, as the caner wound up and, using his full body weight,
struck with the 13mm-thick rattan rod, which had been soaked overnight to
prevent it from splitting.

Finger-like divisions found in the fins of an ancient fish that
lived around 385 million years ago have been hailed by Swedish scientists as the
possible origin of human hands and fingers.


______ (Q) But this study has revealed that they were already
developing when our ancestors were fish.


______ (R) “Our study proves that fingers are not new to tetrapods
but that they evolved from distal radials, structures present in fish
ancestors.” 


______ (S) “It’s an important piece of evidence for the evolution
of fish to tetrapods and how ‘we’ also transformed from fish to land animals.”


______ (T) It had been concluded that digits only developed after
our ancestors made the jump from sea to land 380 million years ago. 


______ (U) “For a long time, we thought that fingers were a
novelty for tetrapods; in the past two years, some evidence has come forward to
make us doubt this,” said Catherine Boisvert, lead scientist.

How great was Ferenc Puskas? Such things, necessarily, are
subjective - and, particularly when you're going on video footage, almost
impossible to judge - but for me he stands alongside Johan Cruyff as one of the
two greatest European soccer players of all time.


______ (Q) "If a good player has the ball, he should have the
vision to spot three team mates or options," the full-back Jeno Buzanszky
said; "Puskas always saw at least five."


______ (R) It is not even the fact that he had key parts in two of
the most celebrated games ever played on British soil - Hungary's 6-3 victory
over England at Wembley in 1953 and Real Madrid's 7-3 victory over Eintracht
Frankfurt in 1960.

______ (S) That is why his nickname, the 'Galloping Major', was so
appropriate - even if he hardly galloped and, at the time it was bestowed, was
only a lieutenant - because he was so good at marshalling his side towards a common
goal. 


______ (T) It is the fact that that ability was allied to a brain
that understood how best to use his ability for the team.


______ (U) It was not just his technical ability because other
players have had that.

"The gods condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly roll a rock to the top of a mountain," wrote Albert Camus, "then the stone would fall back of its own weight; they thought that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor."  

______ (Q) Over and over it happens that a theory or explanation believed to be well established has to be abandoned or rethought of by researchers in the light of new findings.

______ (R) Half a century ago Stanley L. Miller demonstrated that amino acids and other biochemically significant compounds could be easily synthesized under conditions simulating those of the primitive atmosphere.

______ (S) Like Sisyphus, these researchers trying to discover the origins of life and study the earliest stages of biological evolution have an uphill quest because theories must be abandoned and rethought.

______ (T) Nowadays geoscientists tend to doubt that the conditions of the prebiotic environment were as reducing as Miller and others had assumed.

______ (U) Of all the examples, maybe one is the most famous.

The world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon, has a snake-like venom in its bite which sends victims into shock and stops their blood from clotting, according to Australian research.

_____ (Q) Fry also surgically removed a venom gland from a terminally ill Komodo at Singapore Zoo for the study, and said it contained a highly toxic poison which would induce potent stomach cramps, hypothermia and a drop in blood pressure. 

_____ (R) But magnetic resonance imagery has for the first time uncovered venom glands containing a shock-inducing poison which increases blood flow and decreases blood pressure, scientists say. 

_____ (S) Bryan Fry, a leading researcher, said this three-dimensional computer imaging comparing the Komodo's bite with that of Australia's saltwater crocodile showed it used a "grip and rip" pulling manoeuvre to tear deep wounds, similar to a shark or sabre cat.

_____ (T) "Such a fall in blood pressure would be debilitating in conjunction with blood loss and would render the envenomed prey unable to escape," he said. 

_____ (U) It had previously been widely believed that deadly bacteria in the carnivorous lizard's mouth helped kill its prey.

Until 1932, the atom was known to consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by enough negatively charged electrons to make the atom electrically neutral.

______ (Q) This postulation stimulated a search for the particle that culminated in the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in the aforementioned year of 1932. 

______ (R) In addition to the beta particles, certain radioactive nuclei emitted positively charged alpha particles and neutral gamma radiation.

______ (S) Most of the atom was thought to be empty space, with its mass concentrated in a tiny nucleus.

______ (T) The nucleus was thought to contain both protons and electrons because the proton (otherwise known as the hydrogen ion, H+) was the lightest known nucleus and because electrons were emitted by the nucleus in beta particles.  

______ (U) Despite this belief, twelve years earlier, Lord Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer in atomic structure, had postulated the existence of a neutral particle, with the approximate mass of a proton, that could result from the capture of an electron by a proton.

A proper golf swing obviously has an enormous impact on your game of golf.  

______(Q) The golf swing is a great example of the physics of angular motion.  

______(R) Most club heads weigh about the same, so the key to being able to hit the long ball lies in the club head velocity.

______(S) The faster your club head is going at the bottom of your swing, the greater the amount of kinetic energy that will be transferred from club head to the ball because the kinetic energy is proportional to the mass of the club head and the square of its velocity. 

______(T) This torque force changes the angular velocity of the club, causing rotation.  

______(U) The twisting swing produces torque on the club.

The Loch Ness "monster" - affectionately known as "Nessie" - is an alleged plesiosaur-like creature living in Loch Ness, a long, deep lake near Inverness, Scotland.

______ (Q) Many sightings of the "monster" have been recorded, going back at least as far as St. Columba, the Irish monk who converted most of Scotland to Christianity in the 6th century.

______ (R) The locals had known the ancient history of the sea serpent. But after the photo, the scientific experts were called in, and to this day they have found nothing to support the image.

______ (S) Columba apparently converted Nessie, too; for it is said that until he went out on the waters and soothed the beast, she had been a murderess.

______ (T) That photo created quite a fuss because before the photo, Nessie was only the stuff of legend and myth.

______ (U) The modern legend of Nessie begins in 1934 with Dr. Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London physician, who allegedly photographed a plesiosaur-like beast with a long neck emerging out of the murky waters.

A songwriter, itinerant laborer, and union organizer, Joe Hill became famous around the world after a Utah court convicted him of murder in 1915.

______ (Q) Nevertheless, Hill’s integrity, honor and dedication to the welfare of workers became stronger after his trial and death; his well-known ironic humor lasted until the end as well.

______ (R) The conviction, we now know, was an injustice; yet a campaign to exonerate Hill  that began two months before the murder trial was futile.

______ (S) And he did die like a rebel; a member of the firing squad at his execution claimed that the command to "Fire!" had come from Hill himself.

______ (T) Shortly before his execution he wrote to the former president of the Western Federation of Miners: "Goodbye Bill: I die like a true rebel. Don't waste any time mourning, organize workers to protect their rights! It is a hundred miles from here to Wyoming. Could you arrange to have my body hauled to the state line to be buried? I wouldn't want to be found dead in Utah."

______ (U) After a brief service in Salt Lake City, Hill's body was sent to Chicago, where thousands of mourners heard Hill's "Rebel Girl" sung for the first time, listened to hours of speeches and then walked behind his casket to Graceland Cemetery.

______ (R) Pontiac concurred with Neolin's views about autonomy from the English, but also felt the Native Americans had to remain militarily strong to drive the Europeans out of the Ohio Country. 

______ (S) The irony is that although Neolin urged the natives to reject all European customs, missionaries from the Moravian Church heavily influenced his views of the Great Spirit who could save the natives from eternal suffering. 

______ (T) To continue their dependence on European ways would condemn the Indians to eternal suffering.  

______ (U) Therefore, the reason why the Native Americans in the Ohio Country currently suffered at the hands of the English was because they had forgotten the true ways of their people.

Sickle cell anemia is a blood disorder that affects hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells (RBCs) that helps carry oxygen throughout the body. 

______ (Q) Instead of being flexible and disc-shaped, these cells are more stiff and curved in the shape of the old farm tool known as a sickle — that's where the disease gets its name.  

______ (R) They can easily "squeeze" through even very small blood vessels, unlike the sickle-shaped cells. 

______ (S) Red blood cells with normal hemoglobin (hemoglobin A, or HbA) move easily through the bloodstream, delivering oxygen to all of the cells of the body.  

______ (T) Sickle cell anemia occurs when a person inherits two abnormal genes (one from each parent) that cause their RBCs to change shape.  

______ (U) Normal RBCs are shaped like discs or doughnuts with the centers partially "scooped out" and are soft and flexible.

Millions of zoo visitors enjoy watching giant pandas eat.

______ (Q) The panda also uses its powerful jaws and strong teeth to crush the tough, fibrous bamboo into bits for its digestive system to process.

______ (R) To make up for the inefficient digestion, a panda needs to consume a comparatively large amount of food—from 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo each day meaning that a panda must spend 10 to 16 hours a day foraging and eating. 

______ (S) This posture leaves the front paws free to grasp bamboo stems with the help of a "pseudo thumb," formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin.  

______ (T) A giant panda’s digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore, and so much of what is eaten is passed as waste.

______ (U) A panda usually eats while sitting upright, in a pose that resembles how humans sit on the floor.

Paul MacLean, the former director of the Laboratory of the Brain and Behavior at the United States National Institute of Mental Health, developed a model of the brain based on its evolutionary development.

______ (Q) We still carry that reptilian part in our brain (R-complex) but it has been supplemented by an early mammalian brain containing emotion (limbic system) and a more advanced mammalian brain for higher-order thinking (neo-cortex). 

______ (R) It is referred to as the "triune brain theory" because MacLean suggests that the human brain is actually three brains in one.  

______ (S) At one point in the evolution of life, reptiles were the highest life form, but had basic brains that lacked emotional centers – this is why reptiles often do not care for their young. 

______ (T) Each of the layers or "brains" were established successively in response to evolutionary need.  

______ (U) The three layers are the reptilian system, or R-complex, the limbic system, and the neocortex.

Worker bees occasionally kill their queen.

______ (Q) Generally, it has been thought that bees "balled" strange or introduced queens because the foreign queens did not have the proper "colony" odor.

______ (R) To do this, 15 or 20 worker bees collect about her in a tight ball until she starves.

______ (S) More frequently, they will kill a newly introduced or virgin queen.

______ (T) Even if the ball is broken up, the queen seldom survives and the stimulus is powerful enough that the bees taking part in the queen balling are sometimes subsequently balled by other bees.

______ (U) The reason for balling is probably more complicated that that, because bees occasionally will ball their own queen.

One of Einstein's great insights was to realize that matter and energy are really different forms of the same thing. 

______ (Q) Matter can be turned into energy, and energy into matter.

______ (R) Einstein's formula tells us the amount of energy this mass would be equivalent to, if it were all suddenly turned into energy.

______ (S) This is an incredible amount of energy because one Joule is about the energy released when you drop a textbook to the floor: so the amount of energy in 30 grams of hydrogen atoms is equivalent to burning hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline!

______ (T) It says that to find the energy, you multiply the mass by the square of the speed of light, this number being 300,000,000 meters per second (a very large number): 0.111 x 300,000,000 x 300,000,000 = 10,000,000,000,000,000 Joules.

______ (U) For example, consider that in one kilogram of pure water, the mass of hydrogen atoms amounts to just slightly more than 111 grams, or 0.111 kg.

Loosely speaking, a black hole is a region of space that has so much mass concentrated in it that there is no way for a nearby object to escape its gravitational pull. 

______ (Q) Now imagine an object with such an enormous concentration of mass in such a small radius that its escape velocity would be greater than the velocity of light. 

______ (R) Suppose that you are standing on the surface of a planet, and you throw a rock straight up into the air and watch it come back down.  

______ (S) If you could throw the rock hard enough, though, you could make it escape the planet's gravity entirely and it would keep on going forever.  

______ (T) As you would expect, the escape velocity depends on the mass of the planet: if the planet is extremely massive, then its gravity is very strong, and the escape velocity is high. 

______ (U) The speed with which you would need to throw the rock in order that it just barely escapes the planet's gravity is called the "escape velocity."

You don’t have to be Dionysus to make wine.

______ (Q) Then it is necessary to press the “must” in order to squeeze every last delicious drop from the protesting grapes and this extracted juice is poured into a vat.

______ (R) Once the yeast dies, it is cleared out of the wine by adding bentonite which clings to the yeasties and other bad things and then settles to the bottom of the carboy, ultimately resulting in an unencumbered wine ready to age or bottle.

______ (S) The fermentation process is where the grape juice becomes wine when special yeast, added to the juice, converts the natural sugars into alcohol.

______ (T) During the settling, the grape sediment separates from the juice and settles to the bottom of the vat and is transferred, usually by siphon, into different vats and allowed to settle further.

______ (U) After picking grapes it is necessary to crush them into a mass of pulp and juice called "must".

All animals function - to some degree - on instinct: from the tiniest slug, to the largest elephant, to the brainiest human, we all are inherently inclined to perform certain behaviors. 

_____ (Q) This is an innate behavior that is triggered by some sort of sign stimulus and - once initiated - will run to completion.  

_____ (R) However, Konrad Lorenz discovered that it will complete this action even if the egg is removed during the behavior: the goose will simply continue with the behavior as if the egg was still there. 

_____ (S) If an egg is displaced from the nest, the bird will reflexively roll the egg back to the nest with its beak.  

_____ (T) One of the best known examples is the behavior of the nesting Graylag Goose.  

_____ (U) The simplest form of instinct is a fixed-action-pattern.

The human body regulates temperature by keeping a tight balance between heat gain and heat loss.

_____ (Q) Normal core temperature at rest varies between 36.5 and 37.5 °Celsius (°C), which is 97.7 to 99.5 °Fahrenheit (°F).  

_____ (R) The hypothalamus responds to various temperature receptors located throughout the body and makes physiological adjustments to maintain a constant core temperature. 

_____ (S) This normal core temperature is regulated by the hypothalamus (in the brain), which is often called the body’s thermostat.  

_____ (T) Humans regulate heat generation and preservation to maintain internal body temperature or core temperature.  

_____ (U) Your temperature regulation system is more analogous, however, to the operation of a home furnace, as opposed to the function of an air conditioner.

In the 10 years following the unveiling of The Night Watch, Rembrandt's overall artistic output diminished drastically and he produced no painted portraits; either he received no portrait commissions or he stopped accepting such commissions. 

_____ (Q) It has, therefore, been put forth that Rembrandt's crisis may have been purely an artistic one: that he had seen his methods stretched to their practical limits. 

_____ (R) Speculation about what happened after The Night Watch has contributed to the "Rembrandt myth," according to which the artist became largely misunderstood and was ignored. 

_____ (S) There is also no evidence that he was ever "ignored," although he was often the target of his contemporary critics' barbs. 

_____ (T) Often also blamed for Rembrandt's supposed downfall are the death of his wife and the supposed rejection of The Night Watch by those who commissioned it.  

_____ (U) But modern research has found no evidence that the painting was rejected or that Rembrandt experienced deep devastation upon his wife's death.

Octopuses have the largest brains of any invertebrate. 

_____ (Q) Another measure of intelligence the fact that you can count neurons: the common octopus has about 130 million of them in its brain, whereas a human has 100 billion. 

_____ (R) The average is the size of a walnut—as big as the brain of the famous African gray parrot, Alex, who learned to use more than one hundred spoken words meaningfully, which means it's proportionally bigger than the brains of most of the largest dinosaurs. 

_____ (S) For example, researchers who cut off an octopus’s arm (which the octopus can regrow) discovered that not only does the arm crawl away on its own, but if the arm meets a food item, it seizes it—and tries to pass it to where the mouth would be if the arm were still connected to its body.  

_____ (T) But this is where things get weird, because three-fifths of an octopus’s neurons are not in the brain; they’re in its arms. 

_____ (U) “It is as if each arm has a mind of its own,” says Peter Godfrey-Smith, a diver, professor of philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and an admirer of octopuses.

In Keynes' theory, one person's spending goes towards another person's earnings, and when that person spends his or her earnings, he or she is, in effect, supporting another person's earnings.

_____ (Q) Keynes' solution to this poor economic state was to "prime the pump," meaning he argued that the government should step in to increase spending, either by increasing the money supply or by actually buying things itself.     

_____ (R) This cycle continues on and helps support a normal, functioning economy.   

_____ (S) During the Great Depression, however, this was not a popular solution and it is said that the massive defense spending that United States president Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated during World War II helped revive the U.S. economy. 

_____ (T) Under Keynes' theory, this stopped the circular flow of money, keeping the economy at a standstill. 

_____ (U) When the Great Depression hit, people's natural reaction was to hoard their money.

The legendary great white shark is far more fearsome in our imaginations than in reality. 

_____ (Q) As scientific research on these elusive predators increases, their image as mindless killing machines is beginning to fade. 

_____ (R) However, most of these are not fatal.   

_____ (S) It's not a terribly comforting distinction, but it does indicate that humans are not actually on the great white's menu. 

_____ (T) It's true that of the 100-plus annual shark attacks worldwide, fully one-third to one-half are attributable to great whites.  

_____ (U) Indeed, new research finds that great whites, who are naturally curious, are "sample biting" then releasing their victims rather than preying on humans.

After more than 2,000 years of architectural use, the arch continues to feature prominently in bridge designs and with good reason: its semicircular structure elegantly distributes compression through its entire form and diverts weight onto its two abutments, the components of the bridge that directly take on pressure.

_____ (Q) The natural curve of the arch and its ability to dissipate the force outward greatly reduces the effects of tension on the underside of the arch. 

_____ (R) The greater the degree of curvature (the larger the semicircle of the arch), the greater the effects of tension on the underside of the bridge.  

_____ (S) Tensional force in arch bridges, on the other hand, is virtually negligible.  

_____ (T) But as with beams and trusses, even the mighty arch can't outrun physics forever.  

_____ (U) Build a big enough arch, and tension will eventually overtake the support structure's natural strength.

Levassor and his partner Panhard operated one of the largest machine shops in Paris in 1887, when a Belgian engineer named Edouard Sarazin convinced Levassor to manufacture a new high-speed engine for the German automaker Daimler, for which Sarazin had obtained the French patent rights.

_____ (Q) In 1889, visitors to the Paris exposition celebrating the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution were able to admire not only Gustave Eiffel's now-famous tower, but also a Daimler-produced automobile with one of the new Panhard et Levassor-constructed engines.  

_____ (R) In the years to come, this arrangement, known as the Systeme Panhard, would become the model for all automobiles. 

_____ (S) When Sarazin died later that year, the rights passed to his widow, Louise. 

_____ (T) The year after the opening of the exposition, Levassor married Louise Sarazin.  

_____ (U) By 1891, Levassor had built a drastically different automobile, placing the engine vertically in front of the chassis rather than underneath or behind the driver--a radical departure from the carriage-influenced design of earlier vehicles--and put in a mechanical transmission that the driver engaged with a clutch, allowing him to travel at different speeds.

The dawn that followed the dark and frigid night of December 15, 1944 was foggy, dreary, and foreboding to the troops of the VIII Corps in their positions along the front line between Echternach and just south of Konschau in Belgium, a distance of approximately 75 miles, facing the defensive structures the Germans called the Siegfried Line.  

_____ (Q) It had been a quiet sector since early October, and the American front was thinly held, with three infantry divisions on the line and an armored division in reserve.  

_____ (R) Indeed there was no strong or aggressive force facing them, at least in the supposedly trained judgment of unit, divisional, and corps intelligence.  

_____ (S) But it would have been "thinly held" if it had had twice those troops, consisting as it did of widely separated strong points connected generally by a few motorized patrols. 

_____ (T) However the risk must have been considered extremely slight, for commanders all the way down the line were urged to make their men comfortable for the hard winter ahead, and to take measures to reduce the serious problem of trench foot, a disabling disorder resulting from repeatedly wet feet in very cold wet weather.        

_____ (U) They were consequently taking what General Eisenhower described as a "calculated risk" when he had depleted VIII Corps' strength by numerous units to assist Field Marshal Montgomery's planned attack in the north.

The Bohr Model is probably familiar as the "planetary model" of the atom and is used as a symbol for atomic energy (a bit of a misnomer, since the energy in "atomic energy" is actually the energy of the nucleus, rather than the entire atom).

_____ (Q) This similarity between a planetary model and the Bohr Model of the atom ultimately arises because the attractive gravitational force in a solar system and the attractive Coulomb (electrical) force between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons in an atom are mathematically of the same form.

_____ (R) The form is the same, but the intrinsic strength of the Coulomb interaction is much larger than that of the gravitational interaction.

_____ (S) Gravitation is always, however, attractive in our present Universe.

_____ (T) In addition, there are positive and negative electrical charges so the Coulomb interaction can be either attractive or repulsive. 

_____ (U) In the Bohr Model the neutrons and protons occupy a dense central region called the nucleus, and the electrons orbit the nucleus much like planets orbiting the Sun (but the orbits are not confined to a plane as is approximately true in the Solar System).

Water pollution caused by fecal contamination is a serious problem due to the potential for contracting diseases from pathogens (disease causing organisms). 

______ (Q) Coliforms are relatively easy to identify, are usually present in larger numbers than more dangerous pathogens, and respond to the environment, wastewater treatment, and water treatment similarly to many pathogens. 

______ (R) Frequently, concentrations of pathogens from fecal contamination are small, and the number of different possible pathogens is large, so it is not practical to test for pathogens in every water sample collected. 

______ (S) As a result, testing for coliform bacteria can be a reasonable indication of whether other pathogenic bacteria are present.

______ (T) Coliforms come from the same sources as pathogenic organisms.

______ (U) Instead, the presence of pathogens is determined with indirect evidence by testing for an "indicator" organism such as coliform bacteria.

The data collected from the tags showed that sunfish spend 50 per cent of their time in the top 10 meters of the ocean. 

_____ (Q) They mostly feed on zooplankton, an extremely diverse group of simple, slow-moving creatures that includes jellyfish and related animals, which stay close to the surface.

_____ (R) This time is probably spent basking, lying on their side and soaking up heat from the sun.
_____ (S) They generally go to depths of 90 to 170 meters, though the deepest observed dive reached 644 meters.
_____ (T) The rest of the time is spent diving, which they do on average 40 times a day – though hardly ever at night. 
_____ (U) This is by no means as deep as other fish go, but then the sunfish don't need to plunge to the abyssal depths.

The basic premise that the highest truth, or first principle, or Tao, is not expressible in words or conceivable through logical thought, is common to both Taoism and Zen. 

_____ (Q) However, the enlightened Taoist sage is considered to have gained some special knowledge, and thus becomes somehow removed from the world. 

_____ (R) This is obviously not Taoistic quietism (wu-wei) but action where words will not do and the effect is to force the student back into his own mind, rather than to foster a dependence on teachers.

_____ (S) The Zen Master gains nothing other than the realization that there is nothing to gain, and is thus more than ever in the world.

_____ (T) Furthermore, whereas Lao-tzu poetically says "The Tao that can be named is not the real Tao," the Zen Master takes this for granted and if questioned on the subject he might scream "kwatz!" or strike the disciple. 

_____ (U) Both hold, moreover, that an intuitive understanding of the first principle is possible, and this is called enlightenment.

Ceratopsians were slow-moving plant eaters that probably lived together in large herds--hardly the kind of animals you'd associate with deadly conflict. 

_____ (Q) But upon closer examination, the frills are typically too thin to provide much protection.

_____ (R) The huge bony collars, or frills, around the animals' heads seemed to protect their necks.

_____ (S) For many years, paleontologists thought these animals used their horns and spikes to fight predators like T. rex. 

_____ (T) In much the same way, the elaborate skulls of the horned dinosaurs may have been for display, not defense.

_____ (U) And among modern animals from beetles to bison, horns are almost always used to attract mates, compete with rivals or allow animals of the same species to recognize each other.

By the 1800s, chess was essentially the same game we play today, and it is at this time that the concept of a world chess champion began to enter the consciousness of the chess playing public. 

_____ (Q) In 1843, however, Englishman Howard Staunton – the namesake for the now famous Staunton pieces – played two matches with Pierre Saint-Amant, the leading French player of the time. 

_____ (R) But nobody had made the claim that the match was for the world championship, and as such, it was a shaky title, at best.

_____ (S) Staunton emerged victorious, and some observers began to consider the idea that Staunton might be the best player in the world: a world champion, perhaps.  

_____ (T) This lead, therefore, to London 1851 – the first international chess tournament ever held - which was Staunton’s idea: the event being designed to gather all of the best players in Europe. 

_____ (U) The French dominated chess in the 18th century and into the early 19th, with players like Philidor and La Bourdonnais having virtually no equals up until at least the early 1840s.

Brando had a rare gift in that he could turn even a basic line of dialogue, or the most mundane action, into an unforgettable moment. 

_____ (Q) Start off with something fitted, but not skin tight — you shouldn’t look like you’re wearing a hand-me-down from grade school. 

_____ (R) Next, make sure the sleeves hit mid-bicep, anything longer than that will look sloppy, and anything shorter will make you look like a frat boy desperately trying to show off his guns.

_____ (T) Of course you don’t want to look like a slob, so double check for any stains before tossing it on and, to finish it all off, go ahead and try out your signature stare, although to pull that one off, you might need to share in Brando’s gene pool.

_____ (U) The more that an outfit has going on, the easier it is to get noticed, but to turn an ordinary undershirt into something extraordinary you’ll need to take a few notes from the brooding actor.

At the end of the 16th Century, Persia's Shah Abbas had the largest cavalry in the world.

_____ (R) As the wearing of heels filtered into the lower ranks of society, the aristocracy responded by dramatically increasing the height of their shoes - and the high heel was born.
_____ (S) He was keen to forge links with rulers in Western Europe to help him defeat his great enemy, the Ottoman Empire.

_____ (T) In the muddy, rutted streets of 17th Century Europe, these new shoes had no utility value whatsoever - but that was the point: one of the best ways that status can be conveyed is through impracticality.
_____ (U) So in 1599, Abbas sent the first Persian diplomatic mission to Europe - it called on the courts of Russia, Germany and Spain.

The victory over Babylonia expressed all the facets of the policy of conciliation which Cyrus had followed until then.

_____ (R) Brown was unrepentant at trial, stating: "Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done."

_____ (S) After U.S. Marines (commanded by Robert E. Lee) stormed the armory, a wounded Brown was captured.

_____ (T) He thought that "slavery, throughout its entire existence in the United States, is none other than the most barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens against another portion," and he was willing to pursue just about any means at his disposal to stop the practice.

_____ (U) On October 16, 1859, Brown, hoping to obtain weapons for a slave uprising, led a raid on the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia), but Brown and his men were surrounded before they could escape.

In one of the standard methods of primitive potters, rings or coils of clay are built up from a circular base.

_____ (Q) It is not known when or where the potter's wheel was introduced.

_____ (R) When a pot is built up from the base by hand, it is impossible that it will be perfectly round.

_____ (Q) In addition to this, extra revenue was required to support a long and drawn out war with the French, and so a poll tax was introduced.
_____ (R) Recognizing the power of ‘supply and demand’, the remaining peasants began to re-evaluate their worth and subsequently demanded higher wages and better working conditions.
_____ (S) Not surprisingly the government of the day, comprised mainly of the land-owning Bishops and Lords, passed a law to limit any such wage rise.

Recently more research has focused on the relationship between color and psychological functioning.

_____ (Q) Two further experiments establish the link between red and avoidance motivation as indicated by behavioral (i.e., task choice) and psychophysiological (i.e., cortical activation) measures.
  
_____ (R) Four experiments, in fact, demonstrate that the brief perception of red prior to an important test (e.g., an IQ test) impairs performance, and this effect appears to take place outside of participants' conscious awareness.  

_____ (S) Red impairs performance on achievement tasks, because red is associated with the danger of failure in achievement contexts and evokes avoidance motivation.  

_____ (T) All of these findings suggest that care must be taken in how red is used in achievement contexts and illustrate how color can act as a subtle environmental cue that has important influences on behavior. 

_____ (U) Indeed, startling findings occurred in regard to the relationship between red and performance attainment.

On January 14, 1967, counterculture leaders called for a “human be-in” in San Francisco, California. 

_____(Q) The Summer of Love boasted music festivals, poetry readings, speeches, and even theater. 

_____(R) Thousands of people answered the call, gathering in Golden Gate Park to promote peace, happiness, and love. 

_____(S) For the most part, the Summer of Love proved successful in its ability to spread the counterculture message, but by the fall of 1967, increased incidents of crime and drug abuse by hippies gathered in Haight-Ashbury signaled a change in the movement. 

_____(T) The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco quickly became the gathering place and home for many displaced youth who came to celebrate the counterculture event.

I like horses in artwork.   

_____(Q) For example, it takes you from a place of turmoil and conflict to your own hearth.  

_____(R) So, symbolically, the horse often represents what gets you from one (rotten) place to another (better) place.   

_____(S) One reason is that, to me, the horse is a symbol of transition. 

_____(T) Or, it leads you into and out of battle; it helps you escape, engage in some adventure or find new ways.  

_____(U) By transition, I mean transition within our inner reality as well as transition in our external reality. 




‘Decay’ might be a somewhat misleading term as it is used in regard to subatomic particles.  

_____(Q) This then gives you a more stable Nitrogen atom (the difference between types of atoms depends on the number of protons in the nucleus – gain a proton and you become something else). 

_____(R) Atoms experience this type of change due to their ‘instability’ and become more ‘stable’ afterwards.   

_____(S) For instance, C14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons and this is an unstable state for Carbon.  

_____(T) So, poof, a neutron spontaneously can change to a proton and now you get 7 neutrons and 7 protons.  

_____(U) If we are talking about beta decay, for instance, this simply describes a process in which an atom with an overabundance of neutrons experiences the spontaneous change of a neutron into a proton, creating another element completely while also discharging a fast moving electron (a beta particle). 



The artists of the Romantic Movement could see science coming, and it wasn’t pretty.  

_____(Q) There was the outer world (stuff to be perceived, measured and used) and the inner world (perception, thought and emotional responses).   

_____(R) Science seemed to bring an ideology along with it (a technological justification of the worst forms of capitalism) and, schematically, it divided the world into two.  

_____(S) The Romantics, however, believed the mind and body to be a part of nature and connected to nature.  

_____(T) Science, therefore, meant our minds were separate from nature and were to be used to control nature, as if we were secular wizards.  

_____(U) Friedrich Schelling went so far as to say that nature was visible spirit and spirit was invisible nature.

Minhwa is a traditional Korean art form. 

_____(Q) These are insights that would never have been publicly promulgated through the media of the dominant culture. 

_____(R) Minhwa is basically, therefore, the raw, insightful and passionate ‘real’ people (magpies)attacking the established and respected hacks (tigers) in power who control things through connections, quid pro quo arrangements and whatever other forms of shadiness they can think of to try to seem relevant and important. 

_____ (S) Minhwa has represented the experiences and desires of the common people, revealing insights only the people could know about life and society. 

_____ (T) Therefore the tigers aren’t really tigers in Minhwa, they are buffoons just as the aristocracy and power-brokers were, or have been, overwhelmingly, buffoons. 

_____(U) Because it is from the relatively powerless common people, there is often sarcasm and humor in Minhwa, and perhaps some secret social symbolism and criticism, as with magpies mocking vicious and powerful tigers who suddenly look stupid and ridiculous.




While over one million people starved to death in Ireland from 1845 – 1850, boatloads of grain regularly arrived from Ireland, through the port of Liverpool, to feed the citizens of England.  

_____ (Q) The Irish people had been colonized by the English and most Irish worked for various wealthy (mostly English) landlords.  

_____ (R) Thus, the tenant farmers who were dependent on the potato starved while the wealthy landowners reaped tremendous profits from the Irish grain they exported.  

_____ (S) These landlords never even considered stopping the transport of food from Ireland to England so that the Irish themselves might be saved while the potato crop was decimated by a fungus.  

_____ (T) Yet, a famine is when there is no food – there was an overabundance of food…the Irish just weren’t allowed to eat it. 

_____ (U) This was free market capitalism at its most transparently inhumane, but it has come down to us through history whitewashed as the potato ‘famine’.
